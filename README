gbx: (2020)

gbx is a custom (unofficial) toolchain for the Game Boy. It is intended to
enable the development of game software via use of a custom assembly language,
tailored towards the Game Boy hardware.

As of now, gbx is in its early stages and does not have a stable release. Some
features that may be missing are still in development.

Eventual Components of the toolchain:
    An assembler (gb-as)
    A disassemble (gb-dis)
    A linker (gb-ld)


Sample program:

.text ; begin text segment

_start: ; start of program
    nop ; no operation

Build:
    cargo build --release

Basic usage:
    gb-as game.s -o rom.bin
